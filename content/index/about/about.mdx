I'm a 20 years old student, I'm into DevOps, Embedded and Web developpment

Having more than 4 years of experience in software developpment, I worked with a wide range of technologies starting from a VOiP client/ server in C++,
or a Pipeline that tests and deploy autamatically an application from it's last commit within a minute up to optimizing SQL requests with PHP in a SaaS enterprise project.

I'm adapting easily to any kind of new technology

Main technos     |  I'm currently learning
-----------------|----
C/C++          |  JavaScript/TypeScript
Python         |  Azure Cloud
