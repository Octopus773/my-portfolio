The Babel is a project aiming to create a VoIP application. VoIP stands for Voice over Internet Protocol.

You may already know some applications that use this technique (Discord, Skype, or TeamSpeak to name a few).

The Babel consists of a client and a server, clients connect to the server to find other clients and start a call. Calls are made between clients following a Peer-to-Peer architecture.
